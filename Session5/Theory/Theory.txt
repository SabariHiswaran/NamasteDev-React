What is difference between named Export ,Default export and * as export?

named Export -
 we need to use curly braces for importing the named export. 
import {Header} from './'

default export - 
suppose if we have more than one function need to be exported we can export one function by default and another one as named export.
For default export no need to use curly braces. import Header from "../"

* as export - 
In one file if we have exported multiple function then we can import as * and give it a name. Later on whenever needed we can call with that name.

For eg : import {* as Components} from "./"  To call it =>  Components.Header or Components.Footer

what is the importance of config.js file?

Suppose we have hardcoded value which we need to access across the multiple components then we can keep those data in one config file. Then whenever we
needed , it can be accesseed by importing the data from config file.

What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are like normal functions. It was written by fb devs and it can be accessed from React. 
external docs:
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.
 Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
 React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks: useState : To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.

Why do we need a useState Hooks?

React is a one way data-binding. Suppose we need the data that user is typing in text box, the input text will not provide the value to local variable.
So, react has its own local state variable which can be used by useState. This is to acheive the two way data binding. Now we can implement onclick function
and each time we can set the react local state variable so that it will be two way data binding.

One way data binding

here only one way is there from variabe to input 

const/let name = "abc"
<input type ..... value = name />  

Two way data binding

we need to use React local state variable and onchange to update that variable on each user event

const [text, setText] = useState()
input type ... value = {text} onchange(() => ())
